            Simply put, Web Applications are dynamic web sites combined with server side programming which provide functionalities such as interacting with users, connecting to back-end databases, and generating results to browsers.<br>    
            Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application
            through a web browser such as <i>Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox</i>. A majority of web applications can be written in <b>HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.<br>
            Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small
            development team. Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side
            programming. Client refers to a computer application such as a web browser. Client-side
            programming will typically utilize <em>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</em>.<br>

            <em>How can two income couples manage their cash flow without just lumping everything together?</em> I fell like everyone I talk to has some convoluted system of accounts and credit cards or <strong>complete chaos.</strong><br>
            In either case, they are probably letting too much money sit in an account that earns very little return, they are over drafting that account, or they have to spend hours and hours tracking individual expenditures.<br>
