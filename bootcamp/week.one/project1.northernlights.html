            Sólheimajökull glacieris an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded
            by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon
            forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. This popular
            day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the
            name Ice-land!
